This Jenkins plug-in provides utility classes that can be used to accelerate plugin development.

== How to use the plugin

In order to use this small library, add a maven dependency to your pom:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.jenkins.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>plugin-util-api</artifactId>
  <version>[latest version]</version>
</dependency>
----

== General structure of a reporter

In this section I will explain some fundamentals of the design of Jenkins, i.e. the Java model and the associated
user interface elements. If you are already familiar on how to implement the corresponding extension points of a
reporter plugin (see section https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensibility/[Extensibility] in Jenkins'
developer guide), then you can skip this section and head directly to <<extending-jenkins-model>>.

Jenkins organizes projects using the static object model structure shown in <<jenkins-model>>.

The top level items in Jenkins user interface are jobs (at least the top level items
we are interested in). Jenkins contains several jobs of different types (Freestyle jobs, Maven Jobs, Pipelines, etc.).

Each of these jobs contains an arbitrary number of builds (or more technically, runs). Each build is identified by its
unique build number. Jenkins plugins can attach results to these builds, e.g. build artifacts, test results,
analysis reports, etc. In order to attach such a result, a plugin technically needs to implement and create an action
that stores these results.

These Java objects are visualized in several different views, which are described in more detail in the following
sections. The top-level view that shows all available Jobs is shown in <<img-jobs>>.

Plugins can also contribute UI elements in these views, but this is out of scope of this guide.

Each job has a detail view, where plugins can extend corresponding extension points and provide summary boxes and
trend charts. Typically, summary boxes for reporters are not required on the job level, so I describe only trend charts
in more detail, see https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin[ECharts Jenkins plugin].

Each build has a detail view as well. Here plugins can provide summary boxes similar to the boxes for the job details
view. Typically, plugins show here only a short summary and provide a link to detailed results, see <<img-build>> for
an example.

The last element in the view hierarchy actually is a dedicated view that shows the results of a specific plugin. E.g.,
there are views to show the test results, the analysis results, and so on. It is totally up to a given plugin what
elements should be shown there. In the next few sections I will introduce some new UI components that can be used
to show the corresponding results in a pleasant way.

[#extending-jenkins-model]
=== Extending Jenkins object model

Since reporters typically are composed in a similar way, I extended Jenkins' original object model
(see <<jenkins-model>>) with some additional elements, so it will be much simpler to create or implement
a new reporter plugin. This new model is shown in <<jenkins-reporter-model>>. The central element is a build action that
will store the results of a plugin reporter. This action will be attached to each build and will hold (and persist) the
results for a reporter. The detail data of each action will be automatically stored in an additional file, so the
memory footprint of Jenkins can be kept small if the details are never requested by users. Additionally, this
action is also used to simplify the creation of project actions and trend charts, see <<trend-charts>>.

You can find several examples of Jenkins plugins that use this library, e.g.  the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Warnings Next Generation plugin]
or the https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Forensics plugin].
